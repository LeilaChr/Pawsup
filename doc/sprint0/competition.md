# Why are these features not available on Rover, Inc. and PetBacker, Inc.

These competitors are most likely not users of their own apps, so they do not really know the people's needs and wants on a personal level. There is a demand for a larger variety of amenities such as pet toys to keep pets occupied while they are at the sitter's home. Dogs and cats are the two most common household pets, so these competitors did not see much importance in integrating other pets into their software. Pawsup knows that they can get an edge on the competition by allowing support for a larger variety of pets since there is technically still no competition in those fields for pets such as hamsters, fish, snakes, etc. As a bonus, Pawsup offers an integrated store for convenience that no other competitor has. In the store, they sell goods such as pet food and toys which both the petsitters and petowners can purchase. Competitors just assume that you can go to a local shop and purchase them on your own, but what they forget is the appeal of convenience which is captured by Pawsup.

# Costs for Competitors to implement Pawsup's features
It would be quite difficult/costly for Rover Inc. and PetBacker Inc. to implement these features. Although adding a larger variety of amenities for pet-sitters is not that difficult, the major costs lie in the implementation of the "larger variety of eligible pets" and "integrated store to purchase related goods". The larger variety of eligible pets may not come out as fluid as the app was designed with the intention to be solely for dogs and cats. It will require a major UI change (since dogs and cats seem to be hardcoded everywhere) and with their methods, their entire system will require a major change. Similarly, for the store, they would require a completely new payment system as they do not seem to have an "Add to Cart" option like Pawsup. At the moment, they go directly to the checkout from the listing, but they will need to change that entire process if they want users to be able to add relevant products along with a booking for a specific sitter.
