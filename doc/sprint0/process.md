# How did you organize the team?  

We all knew each other a bit before we all enrolled in the course. We used Discord to communicate and we were all enrolled in other mandatory courses together. We agreed that we would divide the work up evenly and we would be able to pick whatever tasks we are most comfortable with. If there exists a conflict with who wants what task, we will have a group discussion to decide how to give the task to a certain person. If the issue cannot be resolved, we'll use the Google Random Number Generator to create a randomly generated number.

# Which tools did you use, if any?  

Discord is used to share documents and screen so everyone can work together and sign documents such as team-contract.pdf.
Figma was utilized to design the user interface and preview basic functionality and theme. The theme and colours will be changed as per the product owner's requirements.  


# How did you make decisions?  

When we need to make an important decision, we will either hold a meeting or discuss in a designated chat to keep as a log. If we cannot come to a unanimous decision, we will reach out either to the product owner, TA, or professor for assistance and based on hearing what they have to say, we will take a vote in favour of the majority.  


# How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?  

We know which user stories are essentials for the app, such as sign-in, log-in, basic functionality of the pages. So those are most important. Next comes up the features such as payments, booking, etc. After that is simply user stories that are meant to enhance the user experience, otherwise known as "satisfier features". For picking user stories with the same level of priority, we look at the benefit:time ratio. If something has a bigger ratio, it is more of a priority than the other.


# How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?  

Usually we'd have a discussion beforehand, so due to that we'd have usually come to a consensus. We never really had any ties, so it was technically 1 round of voting on average.  


# How frequently did you meet?  

We usually meet at least twice a week on Tuesdays starting from 6pm and Saturdays starting from 8pm. The length varies depending on how much content must be shared, but it is always a minimum of 1 hour in length. We add additional meetings when necessary and during meetings, we show our progress, do work together and ask for help/do planning if necessary.

Our first meeting was on September 21st. It was about the team contract. Our second meeting was on September 23rd. It was about competition, personas, UI and user experience. Our third meeting was on September 24th. It was more work on the UI and user experience, user stories, done.md, part of README.md and we showed the product owners some of the app and some ideas to get feedback and check if we're on the right track.

# What lessons should you take forward to the next phase? 

We learned that we should probably start earlier. This allows us to balance the workload rather than piling a lot of stuff on the last 2 days like how Sprint 0 ended up. A reason behind this was since we were unable to contact the product owners and it took a while to find a proper time to meet up on Discord due to other courses. Working early on allows for you to avoid risks of not being to complete the work in time or not getting stuck on a bug for too long. It also ensures that the load is consistent and we are never stuck working on it all day on the last few days.
