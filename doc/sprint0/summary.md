# Objectives:
  Develop an application where pet owners can view listings posted by Pawsup-approved pet-sitters and book for their pets to be supervised 
  by aforementioned sitters for a wide variety of times(ranging from hours to months). Also, provide pet sitters an option to reject incompatible clients.

# Key Users:
- Ali is a 2nd year student studying Medicine.
  He bought a husky, Rusty, during his time
  home for summer break at his parents.
- Jarrod is a high schooler who loves pets,
  but unfortunately he does not have any and would like the chance to take care of one. He
  loves to play sports and go on nature hikes.
  He wants to study veterinary medicine in
  university.
- Jenny has a startup called Pawsup
  whose purpose is be to create a platform
  for pet owners and pet caretakers to
  interact with each other
  
# Key Scenarios:
- Soon his break will be over and he will have
  to leave Rusty with his parents. Ali is unsure
  of his parents capability to give Rusty
  enough attention when he leaves.
  Ali is looking for a place that can provide
  long-term care and lodging for Rusty until
  he returns for his next summer break.
  (approximately 8 months lodging for Rusty). He preferably would like Rusty to be in a
  place that has other dogs as well, so that Rusty is not lonely. 
  At whatever cost Ali's family wants its dogs to be comfortable
- To assist with university costs and gain experience interacting with pets, Jarrod is looking for an opportunity to host cats and dogs 
  short term and has experience grooming pets. He is looking for an opportunity for his services to reach the target demographic.
- Jenny wants to give pet owners a platform to find pet
  sitters willing to take care of their pets.
  As the startup owner, she wants to have
  administrator privileges on the app, so
  that she has final say on if pet sitters are deemed valid to be responsible caretakers on
  her app.
  
# Key Principles:
- Ease of use for Pet owner and pet sitter over simple code.
- Prevention of problems rather than correcting them later
- Compatibility between pet owner's needs and pet sitter's services rather than abundance of possible choices
