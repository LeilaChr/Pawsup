## Good practices in Sprint 2:
- Keep in touch in the Discord chat and by any other means of communication disclosed on `team.md`
- Attempt to conduct a minimum of 3 standup meetings during the sprint.
- Assist each other whenever someone gets stuck to not waste any time.
- Fair distribution of work and commit messages are good.

## New practices for Sprint 3:
- Try to start earlier than when we start at the moment.

## Harmful practices to try to stop for Sprint 3:
- Commit message on GitHub without JIRA User Story.
- Leaving documentation and all required Sprint documents for last second.
- Unbalanced work loads on different members. Thinking some tasks are super easy, but in fact, they become quite difficult and tedious. As a result, the work becomes harder to do.
- Don't get stuck on waiting for 1 person to commit the work that you must use as a dependency. There is always something to do.

## Best/worst experience for Sprint 2:
- Trying to figure out why data is constantly undefined in the frontend and realizing we had to use `useState()`. (Worst)
- Getting the final product working for the demo. (Best)
