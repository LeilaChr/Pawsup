## Good practices for Sprint 1:
- Keep in touch in the Discord chat and by any other means of communication disclosed on `team.md`
- Attempt to conduct a minimum of 3 standup meetings during the sprint.
- Assist each other whenever someone gets stuck to not waste any time.

## New practices for Sprint 2:
- Use better commit messages in Github with JIRA user story.
- Try to distribute work fairly.

## Harmful practices to stop for Sprint 2:
- Commit message on GitHub without JIRA User Story.
- Leaving documentation and all required Sprint documents for last second.
- Unbalanced work loads on different members. Thinking some tasks are super easy, but in fact, they become quite difficult and tedious. As a result, the work becomes harder to do.
- Don't get stuck on waiting for 1 person to commit the work that you must use as a dependency. There is always something to do.

## Best/worst experience for Sprint 1:
- Trying nonstop different stacks just trying to connect frontend to backend to database. (Worst)
- The feeling of getting everything to finally work with no visible bugs and errors. (Best)
