## Sprint 2 Planning Meeting: 

The Sprint 2 planning meeting is being held on October 10, 2021 on Discord. The purpose of this meeting is to clearly indicate the sprint goal, identify all of the stories that will be handled this sprint, related tasks to those stories and how these tasks will be distributed amongst the six team members. All of the team members attended this meeting. The Project Demo to the TA will be done on October 26, 2021. We took care of any document related confusions and then we selected the user stories that we want to handle this sprint, broke it into subtasks and then distributed those tasks.
