## Documentation for Meeting: 

The release planning meeting is being held on September 24, 2021 on Discord. All of our team members attended the release planning meeting. This meeting is being held to determine what features will be available to users during our final presentation. Based on the user stories that are created in Sprint 0, we discussed what the release goals are.

## Release Goal: 

For our release goal, we want to complete all the user stories, have little to no bugs, have a good user experience and ultimately have a functional app. What we mean by this is something that the Pawsup Team would consider and appreciate using as an app for their startup while meeting the product owner's requirements.
